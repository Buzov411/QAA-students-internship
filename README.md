# QA Automation Internship Project

Welcome to the QA Automation Internship Project! This repository is designed as a challenge for internship candidates. The goal of this task is to test and improve your skills in QA automation using TypeScript and Playwright.

## Project Overview

The project contains a single test file: `internship-test-logged-in.spec.ts`. This file includes **three tests**, each with an intentional error. Your task is to find and fix these errors to ensure all tests pass successfully.

## What is Expected From You

1. **Fork This Repository**  
   Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this repository on GitHub to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**  
   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

3. **Set Up the Project**  
   Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands to set up the testing framework:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**  
   You can run the tests in two ways:
   - Click the green play button next to the test in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
   - Or run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     npx playwright test
     ```

5. **Fix and Validate**  
   Debug the file `internship-test-logged-in.spec.ts`, locate the errors in the three tests, and fix them. Ensure all tests pass successfully.

6. **Submit Your Work**  
   Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix test errors"
   git push
   ```
   Then, share the link to your forked repository with us.
