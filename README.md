# QA Automation Internship Project

Welcome to the QA Automation Internship Project! This repository is designed as a challenge for internship candidates. The goal of this task is to test and improve your skills in QA automation using TypeScript and Playwright.

## Project Overview

The project contains a single test file: `internship-test-logged-in.spec.ts`. This file includes **three tests**, each with an intentional error. Your task is to find and fix these errors to ensure all tests pass successfully.

## What is Expected From You

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client.

2. **Create Your Own Repository**  
   Once cloned, create a **new public repository** on GitHub and push the cloned project there. You will share this repository with us after completing the task.

3. **Setup the Framework**  
   After cloning the project, you need to set up the testing framework by running the following commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**  
   You can run the tests in two ways:
   - Press the green play button in the test file (available in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code).
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     npx playwright test
     ```

5. **Fix the Tests**  
   Carefully read through the test file `internship-test-logged-in.spec.ts`. Identify and fix the errors in all three tests. The objective is to ensure all tests pass successfully when executed.

6. **Submit Your Work**  
   Push your changes to your GitHub repository and share the link to your repository with us.

## Additional Information

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- **Documentation**: If you need help with Playwright, refer to the [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
- **Support**: For any queries, you can contact the project team.

We look forward to seeing your solutions and how you approach this task. Good luck, and happy debugging!
